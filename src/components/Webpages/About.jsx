            <p className="text-2xl mr-[80rem]">I am a full stack developer who has a great mind for solving problems of all different calibres. Creating solutions such as <a className="text-Sunset-Orange" href="https://github.com/peter-calabrese/rtxbot">my RTX stock monitoring bot</a> to helping out friends who need <a className="text-Sunset-Orange" href="https://luciafootwearco.vercel.app">a new website for their company</a>. Learning new frameworks and languages is also something I enjoy! The challange of learning something new, coupled with the ability of being able to walk away from a project with more knowledge than when I started, creates a level of excitement and enjpyment in what I do.</p>
